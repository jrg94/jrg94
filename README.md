# Welcome to My Profile!

This week's code snippet, Fizz Buzz in Solisp, is brought to you by [Subete](https://subete.jeremygrifski.com/en/latest/) and the [Sample Programs repo](https://sampleprograms.io/).

```Solisp
(Join (Map num (Seq 1 100)
	(Switch
        {(== (% num 3) (% num 5) 0) "FizzBuzz"}
        {(== (% num 3) 0) "Fizz"}
        {(== (% num 5) 0) "Buzz"}
        {true num}
    )
) "\n")
```
