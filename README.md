# Welcome to My Profile!

This week's code snippet, Baklava in Boo, is brought to you by [Subete](https://subete.jeremygrifski.com/en/latest/) and the [Sample Programs repo](https://sampleprograms.io/).

```Boo
for n in range(-10, 11):
    numSpaces = System.Math.Abs(n)
    numStars = 21 - 2 * numSpaces
    print " " * numSpaces + "*" * numStars
```
