# Welcome to My Profile!

This week's code snippet, Baklava in Chapel, is brought to you by [Subete](https://subete.jeremygrifski.com/en/latest/) and the [Sample Programs repo](https://sampleprograms.io/).

```Chapel
for n in -10..10 {
    var num_spaces = abs(n);
    var num_stars = 21 - 2 * num_spaces;
    writeln(" " * num_spaces + "*" * num_stars);
}
```
