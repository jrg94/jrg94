# Welcome to My Profile!

This week's code snippet, Reverse String in Swift, is brought to you by [Subete](https://subete.jeremygrifski.com/en/latest/) and the [Sample Programs repo](https://sampleprograms.io/).

```Swift
import Foundation

guard CommandLine.argc > 1 else {
    exit(0)
}

let usersString = CommandLine.arguments[1]
let reversedCollection = usersString.reversed()
let reversedString = String(reversedCollection)

print(reversedString)
```
