# Welcome to My Profile!

This week's code snippet, Fizz Buzz in Dart, is brought to you by [Subete](https://subete.jeremygrifski.com/en/latest/) and the [Sample Programs repo](https://sampleprograms.io/).

```Dart
void fizzBuzz(int maxNumber){
  for(int i=1;i<=maxNumber;i++){
    String output = "";
    if(i%3 == 0){
      output += "Fizz";
    }
    if(i%5 == 0){
      output += "Buzz";
    }
    if(output == ""){
      output = "$i";
    }
    print(output);
  }
}

void main() {
  fizzBuzz(100);
}
```
