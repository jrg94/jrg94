# Welcome to My Profile!

This week's code snippet, Reverse String in Vimscript, is brought to you by [Subete](https://subete.jeremygrifski.com/en/latest/) and the [Sample Programs repo](https://sampleprograms.io/).

```Vimscript
func! Reverse(str)
    return join(reverse(split(a:str, '\zs')), '')
endfunc

func! Main(...)
    echo Reverse(a:0 > 0 ? a:1 : '')
endfunc
```
