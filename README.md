# Welcome to My Profile!

This week's code snippet, Baklava in Go, is brought to you by [Subete](https://subete.therenegadecoder.com/en/latest/) and the [Sample Programs repo](https://sample-programs.therenegadecoder.com/).

```Go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		fmt.Println(strings.Repeat(" ", (10-i)) + strings.Repeat("*", (i*2+1)))
	}

	for i := 10; -1 < i; i-- {
		fmt.Println(strings.Repeat(" ", (10-i)) + strings.Repeat("*", (i*2+1)))
	}
}
```
