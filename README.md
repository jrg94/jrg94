# Welcome to My Profile!

This week's code snippet, Baklava in Coffeescript, is brought to you by [Subete](https://subete.jeremygrifski.com/en/latest/) and the [Sample Programs repo](https://sampleprograms.io/).

```Coffeescript
for i in [0...10]
  pattern = " ".repeat (10 - i)
  pattern += "*".repeat (i * 2 + 1)
  console.log pattern

for i in [10..0]
  pattern = " ".repeat (10 - i)
  pattern += "*".repeat (i * 2 + 1)
  console.log pattern
```
