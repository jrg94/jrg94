This week's code snippet, Baklava in Wren, is brought to you by [Subete](https://subete.jeremygrifski.com/en/latest/) and the [Sample Programs repo](https://sampleprograms.io/).

```Wren
for (i in (-10..10)) {
  var numSpaces = (i >= 0) ? i : -i
  System.print(" " * numSpaces + "*" * (21 - 2 *numSpaces))
}
```
