# Welcome to My Profile!

This week's code snippet, Hello World in Visual Basic, is brought to you by [Subete](https://subete.jeremygrifski.com/en/latest/) and the [Sample Programs repo](https://sampleprograms.io/).

```Visual Basic
Public Module HelloWorld
  Public Sub Main()
    System.Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!")
  End Sub
End Module
```
