# Welcome to My Profile!

This week's code snippet, Baklava in Golo, is brought to you by [Subete](https://subete.jeremygrifski.com/en/latest/) and the [Sample Programs repo](https://sampleprograms.io/).

```Golo
module baklava

function main = |args| {
    for (var n = -10, n <= 10, n = n + 1) {
        let numSpaces = Math.abs(n)
        let numStars = 21 - 2 * numSpaces
        println(" " * numSpaces + "*" * numStars)
    }
}
```
