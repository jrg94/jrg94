# Welcome to My Profile!

This week's code snippet, Bubble Sort in Octave, is brought to you by [Subete](https://subete.jeremygrifski.com/en/latest/) and the [Sample Programs repo](https://sampleprograms.io/).

```Octave
function bubble_sort()
    %input validation
    usage = 'Usage: please provide a list of at least two integers to sort in the format "1, 2, 3, 4, 5"';
    arg_list = argv();
    nargin = length(arg_list);
    if  nargin == 0
        %if there was no input
        disp(usage);
        return;
    end

    array_string = arg_list{1};
    array_size = sum(array_string == ',') + 1;
    if array_size < 2
        disp(usage);
        return;
    end

    %build array
    array = str2num(array_string);
    if length(array) ~= array_size || any(mod(array, 1) ~= 0)
        disp(usage);
        return;
    end

    %to keep track of whether any changes have been made on each pass
    flag = 1;

    while flag == 1
        flag = 0;
        for i = 1:array_size-1
            if array(i) > array(i+1)
                temp = array(i+1);
                array(i+1) = array(i);
                array(i) = temp;
                flag = 1;
            end
        end
    end

    %convert to string
    result_string = num2str(array);

    %replace space with ', '
    result_string = regexprep(result_string, '\s+', ', ');
    disp(result_string);
end
```
