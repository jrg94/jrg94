# Welcome to My Profile!

This week's code snippet, Baklava in Groovy, is brought to you by [Subete](https://subete.therenegadecoder.com/en/latest/) and the [Sample Programs repo](https://sample-programs.therenegadecoder.com/).

```Groovy
(0..9).each{ index ->
    println "${' ' * (10 - index)}${'*' * (index * 2 + 1)}"
}
(9..0).each{ index ->
    println "${' ' * (10 - index)}${'*' * (index * 2 + 1)}"
}
```
