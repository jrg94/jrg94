# Welcome to My Profile!

This week's code snippet, Fizz Buzz in Pinecone, is brought to you by [Subete](https://subete.jeremygrifski.com/en/latest/) and the [Sample Programs repo](https://sampleprograms.io/).

```Pinecone
i: 1 | i <= 100 | i: i + 1 @ (
    i % 15 = 0 ? (
        print: "FizzBuzz"
    ) |
    i % 3 = 0 ? (
        print: "Fizz"
    ) |
    i % 5 = 0 ? (
        print: "Buzz"
    ) | (
        print: i
    )
)
```
