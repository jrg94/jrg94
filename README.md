# Welcome to My Profile!

This week's code snippet, Baklava in Solisp, is brought to you by [Subete](https://subete.therenegadecoder.com/en/latest/) and the [Sample Programs repo](https://sample-programs.therenegadecoder.com/).

```Solisp
(Join (Map x (Append (Seq 0 10) (Reverse (Seq 0 9)))
	(Join (Append
		(Clone (- 10 x) " ")
		(Clone (+ (* x 2) 1) "#")
	))
) "\n")
```
