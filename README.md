# Welcome to My Profile!

This week's code snippet, Hello World in Unicat, is brought to you by [Subete](https://subete.jeremygrifski.com/en/latest/) and the [Sample Programs repo](https://sampleprograms.io/).

```Unicat
Memory 0 = 0o110 (72 = 'H')
 Output memory 0
 Memory 0 = 0o145 (101 = 'e')
 Output memory 0
 Memory 0 = 0o154 (108 = 'l')
 Output memory 0
 Output memory 0
 Memory 1 = 0o157 (111 = 'o')
 Output memory 1
 Memory 2 = 0o54 (44 = ',')
 Output memory 2
 Memory 2 = 0o40 (32 = ' ')
 Output memory 2
 Memory 2 = 0o127 (87 = 'W')
 Output memory 2
 Output memory 1 ('o')
 Memory 2 = 0o162 (114 = 'r')
 Output memory 2
 Output memory 0 ('l')
 Memory 2 = 0o144 (100 = 'd')
 Output memory 2
 Memory 2 = 0o41 (33 = '!')
 Output memory 2
 Memory 2 = 0o12 (10 = '\n')
