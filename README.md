# Welcome to My Profile!

This week's code snippet, Hello World in C2, is brought to you by [Subete](https://subete.jeremygrifski.com/en/latest/) and the [Sample Programs repo](https://sampleprograms.io/).

```C2
module hello_world;

import stdio as io;

func i32 main(i32 argc, char** argv) {
    io.printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
