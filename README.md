# Welcome to My Profile!

This week's code snippet, Capitalize in Dart, is brought to you by [Subete](https://subete.jeremygrifski.com/en/latest/) and the [Sample Programs repo](https://sampleprograms.io/).

```Dart
import 'dart:io';

main(List<String> args) {

  if (args.isEmpty || args[0].isEmpty) {
    print("Usage: please provide a string");
    exit(1);
  }

  print(capitalize(args[0]));
}

String capitalize(String input) =>
    '${input[0].toUpperCase()}${input.substring(1)}';
```
