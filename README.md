# Welcome to My Profile!

This week's code snippet, Reverse String in Scheme, is brought to you by [Subete](https://subete.jeremygrifski.com/en/latest/) and the [Sample Programs repo](https://sampleprograms.io/).

```Scheme
(define (reverse-string x)
  (list->string (reverse (string->list x))))

(if (> (length (command-line)) 1)
  (display (reverse-string (list-ref (command-line) 1)))
)
```
