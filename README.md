# Welcome to My Profile!

This week's code snippet, Even Odd in Php, is brought to you by [Subete](https://subete.jeremygrifski.com/en/latest/) and the [Sample Programs repo](https://sampleprograms.io/).

```Php
<?php

if ($argc < 2 || !is_numeric($argv[1])) {
    die("Usage: please input a number\n");
}

$input = abs($argv[1]);

if ($input % 2 == 0) {
    echo "Even\n";
} elseif ($input % 2 == 1) {
    echo "Odd\n";
}
```
